Most relevant files in this repository:
** Final report
*Final_Notebook.ipynb* Has example code to start training and loads pre-trained models and runs simple evaluation
*Depp_Learning_Poster.pdf* Poster used in poster-session.
*Impala_without_death_penalty_reward_10.mp4* and *Impala_with_death_penalty_5_reward_62.mp4* in Videos folder. Video examples that illustrate the behavioural differences highlighted in the report. 
*all the .py files* contains the source code used to create and train models.

Most of the other files required to be mounted on drive and have access to files generated by the authors and will not be able to run as-is for other users.
